"""
Gene Data Analysis Spider
=========================

This Scrapy Spider is designed to analyze gene data from various sources.
It is structured to be easily understandable, maintainable, and extensible.

To run the spider, ensure that the `GENE_DATA_SPIDER_SETTINGS` are configured in your `settings.py` file.
This includes the `allowed_domains` and `start_urls` for the spider to begin its data extraction process.

Usage:
    python gene_data_analysis.py

This will initiate the spider and start the data extraction process.
